Q how  javascript programming work ?

Detailed Definition
JavaScript is:

High-level: Every program needs some hardware resources. In JavaScript, there’s 
no need to manage resources such as memory and CPU.

Interpreted: JavaScript engine translates JavaScript code into machine code.

Garbage Collected: An algorithm inside the JavaScript engine that automatically 
removes old unused objects from memory. It cleans computer memory from time to time.

Just in Time Compiled: Computer processors only understand 0s and 1s (machine code).
 JavaScript is an Abstraction over 0s and 1s (machine code). Translation of JavaScript
  to machine code happens inside the JavaScript engine during compilation.

Dynamically Typed: We don’t declare the type of a variable. It is determined at runtime.

Strongly Typed: We declare the type of a variable. We cannot assign a value of different
 type to a variable.

Multi-paradigm: Approach of Structuring code i.e. Coding Style. JavaScript use all three
 types of paradigm: Procedural Programming, OOPs, and Functional Programming


Prototype-based Object-Oriented: Everything in JavaScript is an object except 
primitive values (numbers, strings, etc).

First-class Functions: Functions are treated as variables. We can pass functions
 into other functions and return them from functions.

Dynamic: We don’t assign data types. Types become known at runtime. They can also be 
changed.

Single-threaded and Non-blocking Event Loop: First we need to understand the Concurrency
 Model. The Concurrency Model is how the JavaScript engine handles multiple tasks
  happening at the same time. We need it because JavaScript runs in one single 
  thread, so it can perform only one thing at a time and therefore, we need a way 
  to handle multiple things happening at the same time. In case we have a long-running
   task, it would block the single thread. Hence, we use an Event Loop. It takes 
   long-running tasks, executes them in the background, and puts them back in 
   the main thread once they are finished.

JavaScript Engine ::: ----------------------->>>

JavaScript Engine executes JavaScript code. It contains:

Call Stack: Where the code is executed using Execution Contexts.
Heap: Unstructured memory pool that stores all the objects that our application needs


JavaScript Code (.js) --> JIT Compiler --> Machine Code --> JavaScript Virtual Machine --> Running Code


Key Points:
JIT Compiler: JavaScript engines like V8 use Just-in-Time compilation, compiling JavaScript into machine code at runtime.
Execution Context: Manages variables, functions, and scope during code execution.
Event Loop: Handles asynchronous tasks and ensures non-blocking behavior.
Modules: JavaScript supports modular code both on the client (with <script>) and server-side (with CommonJS or ES6 imports).




Here’s the step-by-step explanation for JavaScript, corresponding to your Python flow:

Step-by-Step Explanation of How JavaScript Works:
JavaScript Code (Source Code)

You write JavaScript code in .js files (or embedded in HTML for web development).
The code may also import library modules using either traditional script tags (in browsers) or ES6 module imports (e.g., import { func } from 'module';) for both client-side and server-side JavaScript.
JavaScript Engine (Just-in-Time Compilation)

JavaScript is an interpreted language, but modern JavaScript engines (like Google's V8, which powers Chrome and Node.js) use Just-in-Time (JIT) compilation.
When the JavaScript code is run, the JavaScript engine compiles the code on the fly into machine code for the current system, making it much faster than older JavaScript interpreters.
The JIT compiler optimizes the code while it runs by compiling frequently used parts of the code into native machine code.
Execution Context

The JavaScript engine creates an execution context for your code, including the call stack and heap memory.
The execution context helps manage variables, functions, and the scope (global or local) in which they operate.
JavaScript Virtual Machine

Similar to Python's PVM, JavaScript engines use a virtual machine to manage the execution of the code, whether it's running in a browser or a server environment like Node.js.
The JavaScript Virtual Machine executes the compiled machine code generated by the JIT compiler.
Running Code

Once the code is compiled, the JavaScript engine executes it, interacting with the system's memory and resources (such as DOM manipulation in browsers, or file system/network operations in Node.js).
JavaScript is single-threaded but can handle asynchronous tasks through event loops, callbacks, Promises, or async/await.
Library Modules

Client-Side (Browser): You can include libraries in the browser using <script> tags (for example, external libraries like jQuery, or local libraries).
Node.js (Server-Side): JavaScript supports CommonJS modules in Node.js (e.g., require('module')) or ES6 module imports (e.g., import { func } from 'module').
Libraries are executed as part of the normal JavaScript execution process, with their code compiled and optimized by the JavaScript engine.



Q how python programming language work?

Step-by-Step Explanation of How Python Works:
Python Code (Source Code)

You write Python code in .py files, which contains human-readable instructions using Python syntax.
The code can import library modules (standard or third-party libraries) that provide additional functionality like handling files, math operations, web requests, etc.
Python Interpreter (Compiler to Bytecode)

Python is an interpreted language, but it compiles your source code into an intermediate form called bytecode.
When you run the Python code (e.g., python myscript.py), the Python interpreter reads the code line by line and translates it into bytecode.
Bytecode is a lower-level, platform-independent representation of the code. It's not human-readable, but it's much faster to execute than pure source code.
Bytecode (.pyc files)

The bytecode is usually stored in .pyc files (compiled Python files) in a folder called __pycache__.
Bytecode speeds up subsequent executions of the program, as it doesn't need to be recompiled each time unless the source code changes.
Python Virtual Machine (PVM)

The bytecode is then executed by the Python Virtual Machine (PVM).
The PVM is a part of the Python runtime environment that interprets the bytecode and translates it into machine code (specific to the operating system you're running on).
This virtual machine executes the code in a way that's independent of the hardware and operating system, making Python cross-platform.
Running Code

The PVM runs the translated machine code and interacts with the system's resources (memory, CPU, I/O operations) to perform the task, such as printing output, handling files, or accessing a database.
Library Modules

Standard Libraries: Python comes with a vast standard library that provides built-in modules for common tasks (e.g., os, sys, math, datetime, http, etc.).
Third-Party Libraries: You can also install and use third-party libraries via package managers like pip (e.g., requests for HTTP requests, numpy for scientific computing).
These libraries can be loaded into your Python program using the import statement and are compiled to bytecode and executed by the PVM just like the rest of your code.
Summary of Flow:


                                         library Modules
code   --> compiler   --> byte code  --> virtual machine  --> running code


Python Code (.py) --> Python Interpreter --> Bytecode (.pyc) --> Python Virtual Machine (PVM) --> Running Code

Key Points:
Compiler: The Python interpreter compiles the source code into bytecode.
Bytecode: An intermediate representation that is platform-independent.
PVM: Executes the bytecode and translates it into machine-specific instructions.
Libraries/Modules: Provide reusable code and functionality, imported during execution and treated like any other code.

Introduction (00:00): Overview of the concepts and topics that will be discussed
 in the session.

Computer Architecture (00:39): Covers fundamental components of a 
computer system such as disk storage, RAM, cache, and CPU, and how they interact.

Production App Architecture (04:22): Discusses the architecture of 
applications in production environments, focusing on CI/CD (Continuous 
Integration/Continuous Deployment), load balancers, and logging & monitoring tools.

Design Requirements (07:12): Explores key system design principles such as
 the CAP theorem, throughput, latency, and service-level objectives (SLOs)
  and agreements (SLAs).


Networking (14:40): Explains networking fundamentals like TCP,
 UDP, DNS, IP addresses, and IP headers.

Application Layer Protocols  Discusses different 
protocols used at the application layer such as HTTP, WebSockets, WebRTC, and MQTT.


API Design (24:01): Provides guidelines and best practices
 for designing APIs.

Caching and CDNs (29:19): Covers caching strategies and content delivery 
networks (CDNs) to optimize performance and scalability.

Proxy Servers (36:33): Differentiates between forward and reverse proxy 
servers and explains their roles in a network.

Load Balancers (42:36): Explains how load balancers distribute traffic
 across multiple servers to ensure high availability and reliability.

Databases (48:05): Discusses database design and scaling strategies such 
as sharding, replication, ACID (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability)
 properties, and vertical vs. horizontal scaling.
